      <description>Anvi&amp;rsquo;o is a powerful tool for analyzing and vizualizing &amp;lsquo;omics data, much of which relies on one&amp;rsquo;s ability to visualize those data. On Poseidon, it can sometimes be difficult to work with these kinds of plotting tools, because we&amp;rsquo;re working on the command line. To use anvi&amp;rsquo;o interactively on Poseidon, we need to go through a few extra steps.
I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the whole installation of anvi&amp;rsquo;o here from start to finish!</description>

      <description>RStudio was once my favorite and most often-used IDE. And there are still a lot of reasons to use it, even if you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to something like Spyder or Jupyter. RStudio is a clean IDE that allows you to simultaneously view your filesystem, environment variables, R scripts, and console, and is all very specifically tailored to R, which is important in many cases (R is an amazing but finicky language).</description>

      <description>There are a lot of reasons to set up Google Drive integration on your remote HPC system. In particular if your institution has provided you access to G Suite, there is a lot of storage available on Google Drive. Sometimes you might want to access files from multiple HPC systems, or have them at your fingertips on your local machine in addition to a remote server. This blog post will go over how to set up and use rclone with Google Drive on your remote server.</description>

Unfortunately, depending on your existing setup on your computer, you may have a few extra steps to wrangle if you have a PC. In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll highlight what you should do after you get the Jupyter notebook running on the remote. In other words, you should have already gotten to the step where you spin up the Jupyter notebook, as in:</description>
