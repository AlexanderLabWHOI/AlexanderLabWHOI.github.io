      <description>RStudio was once my favorite and most often-used IDE. And there are still a lot of reasons to use it, even if you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to something like Spyder or Jupyter. RStudio is a clean IDE that allows you to simultaneously view your filesystem, environment variables, R scripts, and console, and is all very specifically tailored to R, which is important in many cases (R is an amazing but finicky language).</description>

      <description>Over the last few years I have made a transition in my workflow from doing most of my data exploration and plotting on my local machine (a 2016 MacBook laptop) to doing most of my plotting on a remote HPC (check out this other blog post for more on that). This workflow is very convenient for many reasons (keeping all files in one location, more extensibility and power for my notebooks that my personal laptop can&amp;rsquo;t handle, minimizing file storage on my local machine, etc.</description>

      <description>Are you a recent (or not so recent) graduate with an interest in biological oceanography or marine biology? Do you have molecular biology experience in the lab? Are you curious to learn more about how molecular biology can be used to study environmental systems?
I am excited to announce that Carolyn Tepolt and I are looking to hire a joint research assistant (i.e. lab tech) to join our labs at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.</description>

      <title>Using `rclone` to manage data on a remote server via Google Drive</title>

      <description>There are a lot of reasons to set up Google Drive integration on your remote HPC system. In particular if your institution has provided you access to G Suite, there is a lot of storage available on Google Drive. Sometimes you might want to access files from multiple HPC systems, or have them at your fingertips on your local machine in addition to a remote server. This blog post will go over how to set up and use rclone with Google Drive on your remote server.</description>

      <description>I am heading to Ocean Sciences Meeting next week in San Diego along with Laura Blum, an undergraduate researcher doing her thesis research with Maria Pachiadaki, Erin Eggleston, and myself. We have two presentations (that are bookending the meeting &amp;ndash; Monday and Friday) that are both related to work we have been doing looking at MAGs from the larger size fraction metagenomic datasets generated as part of the Tara Expedition.</description>

      <description>Harriet wrote an awesome blog post here about how to use a Jupyter notebook connected to a remote server via SSH tunneling. Unfortunately, depending on your existing setup on your computer, you may have a few extra steps to wrangle if you have a PC. In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll highlight what you should do after you get the Jupyter notebook running on the remote. In other words, you should have already gotten to the step where you spin up the Jupyter notebook, as in:</description>

      <title>Keeping my R life organized</title>

      <description>I recently found myself setting up a new computer, spinning up ~23864283.34 new projects in R, and wanting to stay somewhat organized in the process. After doing some digging, I decided to give Anaconda environments a try to have the ability to run different versions of R and do this across R on the command line, RStudio, and jupyter notebooks (IRKernel). I have decided to share my process.
Installing Anaconda First, let&amp;rsquo;s make sure Anaconda is installed.</description>

      <title>Running Jupyter Notebooks Remotely with Slurm</title>

      <description>I run the bulk of my bioinformatic analyses remotely on a server or HPC, as they require more computational power or space than I have on my local computer. Rather than transfer the intermediate byproducts of these analyses (which may often be very large) to my local machine, I prefer to examine and analyze the data remotely using Jupyter. As jupyter notebook are browser-based, if you run the command jupyter notebook on a remote machine you will not be able to automatically interact with the jupyter dashboard as you do not have access to a browser on the remote machine.</description>

      <description>Two months ago, I started in the Biology Department at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as an Assistant Scientist. The processes has been otherworldly. Suddenly I find myself the steward of my own ship (read: lab). My emotional state seems to oscillate between excited exhilaration and existential terror (O 3 kHz). I have spent the last 11 (or more) years working towards this very moment&amp;ndash; so it is surreal to have officially arrived.</description>
