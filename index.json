After doing some digging, I decided to give Anaconda environments a try to have the ability to run different versions of R and do this across R on the command line, RStudio, and jupyter notebooks (IRKernel). I have decided to share my process.\nInstalling Anaconda First, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure Anaconda is installed. If you do not have Anaconda, follow instructions here to install.\nOnce you have Anaconda installed, check the version.\nconda -V # I'm currently running v4.6.8 which conda # Location on my computer: /Users/shu/anaconda3  Why did you make me install anaconda? Briefly, Anaconda, or conda, is a software package manager. Anaconda will make your scientific programming life easier by facilitating software installations for many programs or packages. You can google \u0026lsquo;conda install for software X\u0026rsquo;, and often find a single line command to install the most recent version of that software.\nEven better, Anaconda allows you to create compartmentalized computational environments (called \u0026ldquo;conda environments\u0026rdquo; in this post) where you can install any mixture of things you require without accidentally messing up other software downloads on your computer. You can use these conda environments in any number of ways\u0026ndash; they can be program-specific (for the running of one specific tool) or project-specific (to store versions for a whole workflow). For instance, I\u0026rsquo;m working on a collaborative project which requires building bioinformatic pipelines with several different programs. It is key that my collaborator and I maintain the same versions of software, so code that we write individually can be easily shared. For this, we created and shared a conda environment. More info on getting started with conda here.\nConda environments have been widely adopted as a means of facilitating reproducible computation across the Python ecosystem\u0026ndash; but is now expanding to include other programming languages such as R (more here).\nBelow, documents how I have built up conda environments to run specific versions of R, including RStudio and jupyter notebooks.\nCreating a conda environment for R First, list the conda environments you have locally:\nconda info --envs  The output should list all the conda environments you have created. An asterisk will denote where you currently are, likely \u0026lsquo;base\u0026rsquo;. Additionally, your command line will be preceded with \u0026lsquo;(base)\u0026rsquo; to denote you are in your base conda environment.\nFirst, we will generate a specific R environment for R v3.5.1 (most recent version available through Anaconda, as of April 2019).\nconda create --name r_3.5.1 -c r r=3.5.1 r-essentials   What is happening in this command?\n \u0026lsquo;conda create \u0026ndash;name r_3.5.1\u0026rsquo; creates a new conda environment that will be called \u0026lsquo;r_3.5.1\u0026rsquo;. \u0026rsquo;-c r r=3.5.1\u0026rsquo; specifies to use the \u0026lsquo;r\u0026rsquo; channel for installation. In this particular case, we also specify r=3.5.1. Without this last part, conda will automatically install the most recent version of R. \u0026lsquo;r-essentials\u0026rsquo;, upon installing R-related packages, you need to add \u0026lsquo;r-\u0026rsquo; ahead of the package name. r-essentials is a package bundle which has a lot of the most basic and commonly used R packages. A full list of packages available for conda install.   This installation will take a few minutes and at the end you should see something like the following:\npip 19.1############################################################################################################################################## | 100% r-highr 0.7########################################################################################################################################### | 100% r-sourcetools 0.1.7################################################################################################################################### | 100% Preparing transaction: done Verifying transaction: done Executing transaction: done # # To activate this environment, use: # \u0026gt; source activate r_3.5.1 # # To deactivate an active environment, use: # \u0026gt; source deactivate #  Now, list your conda environments again with conda info --envs. You should now see the new environment listed:\nbase * /Users/shu/anaconda3 r_3.5.1 /Users/shu/anaconda3/envs/r_3.5.1  To activate your newly created R environment type:\nsource activate r_3.5.1  Your terminal prompt should now be preceded by your conda environment name, in this case (r_3.5.1), and the asterisk should be listed next to r_3.5.1 rather than basein the conda info --envs output.\nCheck that the correct R version is running We can check the version of R in two ways.\nFirst, launch R by typing R, you should see R version 3.5.1 (\u0026ldquo;Feather Spray\u0026rdquo;) load. IF you got an error about the \u0026ldquo;java\u0026rdquo; command-line tool, visit this site to fix it.. I got this error using anything \u0026gt;10.10 on Mac OS X.\nThe first line after typing R should be:\nR version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02) -- \u0026quot;Feather Spray\u0026quot; Copyright (C) 2018 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0 (64-bit)  Because we created this R environment and specified r-essentials, many popular packages have already been loaded. Check this by loading some basic libraries library(ggplot2) or library(dplyr). Convenient, eh?\nQuit R quit(), but don\u0026rsquo;t deactivate the r_3.5.1 environment.\nSecond, we can also directly check which R is being called by our $PATH in the conda environment by typing which R. This should output something like the following:\n/Users/shu/anaconda3/envs/r_3.5.1/bin/R  This indicates that R is being called from the bin in your newly created conda environment (anaconda3/envs/r_3.5.1/bin/).\nKeep this path in mind as we set up jupyter notebook and RStudio below, as they also need to launch R from this same location.\nCreating a jupyter notebook in R Jupyter notebook for R was included in the r-essential package download. To launch, type:\njupyter notebook  This will open the jupyter notebook home screen in browser window, showing your current directory. At the top right, you can click New and see which kernels you can use to start a notebook (hopefully, Python 3 or R).\n~Select R under the \u0026lsquo;New\u0026rsquo; dropdown menu (you can also launch a Python3 notebook\u0026hellip; but that isn\u0026rsquo;t what we are doing right now), and a new Untitled.ipynb will open. In the first cell, enter version and execute the cell (SHIFT+ENTER to execute). This should print out the version of R that the notebook is running\u0026ndash; which should be 3.5.1. You can also ensure this R notebook is running properly by loading some R libraries.\nTo close the notebook, click Logout at the top right of the notebook open in your browser and/or CTRL+C in the terminal from where you launched the notebook. Close the browser windows.\nOne of the major issues I have encountered is Jupyter calling the incorrect path (more below).\nIf for some reason when you create this new notebook and you notice that the version is incorrect you can dig a bit deeper into the kernel details. To do this, you can\u0026rsquo;t use which R (as above) as that doesn\u0026rsquo;t answer where Jupyter is looking. Rather, you can use jupyter kernelspec, a command that I have found invaluable in troubleshooting any PATH issues in jupyter notebooks see twitter feed for that eureka moment.\nTo see what paths are being called by jupyter notebook type this:\njupyter kernelspec list --json  As an example, here is my output:\n{ \u0026quot;kernelspecs\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;python3\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;resource_dir\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/Users/shu/anaconda3/envs/r_3.5.1/share/jupyter/kernels/python3\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;spec\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;argv\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;/Users/shu/anaconda3/envs/r_3.5.1/bin/python\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-m\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ipykernel_launcher\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-f\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;{connection_file}\u0026quot; ], \u0026quot;env\u0026quot;: {}, \u0026quot;display_name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Python 3\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;language\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;python\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;interrupt_mode\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;signal\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;metadata\u0026quot;: {} } }, \u0026quot;ir\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;resource_dir\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/Users/shu/anaconda3/envs/r_3.5.1/share/jupyter/kernels/ir\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;spec\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;argv\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;R\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;--slave\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-e\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;IRkernel::main()\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;--args\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;{connection_file}\u0026quot; ], \u0026quot;env\u0026quot;: {}, \u0026quot;display_name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;R\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;language\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;R\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;interrupt_mode\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;signal\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;metadata\u0026quot;: {} } } } }  This command returns the paths (resource_dir) that the jupyter notebook when opened in the r_3.5.1 environment is accessing. The key point is that you should see that resource_dir for both python and ir (read: R) kernels should be within your conda environment path (.../anaconda3/envs/r_3.5.1/...).\nFrom my experience, a common issue I encountered was jupyter notebook trying to use an R version that was external to my environment (i.e. from an R version installed in my base environment or an old R version installed on my computer pre-anaconda). These issues manifest as IRKernel in jupyter notebook never becomes active or dying immediately after launch. This cause of this problem was revealed with the kernelspec command above.\nOne of the main lessons I learned in troubleshooting: don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to destroy everything. More specifically, if you run into issues and find that one or all of these paths are not shuttling through the correct R conda environment of your choice\u0026hellip; destroy and rebuild. Use this command (jupyter kernelspec) to locate and destroy this other R option that jupyter notebook is defaulting to (but make sure you are not deleting another whole environment!).\nOpening RStudio within a conda environment To run RStudio in our environment, we can use the single-line conda command conda install -c r rstudio. However, it is important to specify the version of R that we want to install:\nconda install -c r r=3.5.1 rstudio # As of April 2019, this installs RStudio v1.1.456  Launch RStudio by typing rstudio. The first line in the RStudio console should be the same as when we launched R from the command line directly R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02) -- \u0026quot;Feather Spray\u0026quot;. To close RStudio, you can close RStudio itself, or CTRL+C in the terminal from where you launched it.\nMoreover, by creating a specific alias, we can more precisely tell RStudio to open as a specific version (within a conda environment).\nFirst, perform a check to make sure RStudio is launching from the same location as R in this environment.\nwhich R # Output: /Users/sarahhu/anaconda3/envs/r_3.5.1/bin/R which rstudio # Output: /Users/sarahhu/anaconda3/envs/r_3.5.1/bin/rstudio  Copy the output from which R and open your bash profile (~/.bash_profile) using a text editor.\nAdd this line:\n# R version alias alias rstu3.5=\u0026quot;RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=/Users/shu/anaconda3/envs/r_3.5.1/bin/R open -a rstudio\u0026quot;  You can then source your bash profile to add that command to your current terminal session.\n# Source bash profile source ~/.bash_profile  Make sure you are still in your r_3.5.1 environment (sourcing your bash profile may place you back in your base environment). From the command line (in your r_3.5.1 environment) you can now type rstu3.5 to launch RStudio. I highly recommend opening RStudio from the command line using this alias you created! I found it was a much more stable way to work with RStudio.\nCreating a conda environment with a different R version Alright, so this is the moment of truth: can you successfully support two different R versions on your computer with conda environments?\nFirst, (if you aren\u0026rsquo;t already) logout of the r_3.5.1 conda environment with conda deactivate.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try installing an older version of R\u0026ndash; 3.4.3. So, we will repeat the above instructions to create a new environment, but specify R\u0026ndash; 3.4.3.\n# Create new R environment with R version 3.4.3 conda create --name r_3.4.3 -c r r=3.4.3 r-essentials # Enter environment source activate r_3.4.3  Now, we can do the same checks that we did above. First, launch R on the command line and then spin up a jupyter notebook with an R kernel to check that they are both running R v3.4.3.\nNext, reinstall RStudio with R v.3.4.3\n# Install RStudio conda install -c r r=3.4.3 rstudio  And then ensure that you are running the correct version by opening RStudio from the command line (rstudio).\nYou should then double check the paths of R and rstudio within this environment:\n# Check outputs which R # Output: /Users/shu/anaconda3/envs/r_3.4.3/bin/R which rstudio # Output: /Users/shu/anaconda3/envs/r_3.4.3/bin/rstudio  If all things check out:\n[x] Correct R version in command line [x] Correct R version in RStudio [x] Correct R version in Jupyter Notebook [x] Path of R aligns with your specified conda environment [x] Path of rstudio aligns with your specified conda environment\nYou can safely go ahead and create a new alias within your .bash_profile :\nalias rstu3.4=\u0026quot;RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=/Users/shu/anaconda3/envs/r_3.4.3/bin/R open -a rstudio\u0026quot;  Finally, now when you list your conda environments conda info --envs you will see both new R environments.\n# conda environments: # base /Users/shu/anaconda3 r_3.4.3 * /Users/shu/anaconda3/envs/r_3.4.3 r_3.5.1 /Users/shu/anaconda3/envs/r_3.5.1  What other R versions are available for conda install? To check out other available R versions built through conda you can search the R channel using conda:\nconda search -c r r  Installing R packages To install other R packages, rather than use \u0026lsquo;install.packages()\u0026rsquo; in the R console, I recommend googling conda + PACKAGE-NAME or searching the conda R channel (conda search -f r-PACKAGENAME) for the package you want to install. When you are ready to install a package, make sure you are in the conda environment with whatever R version you want the package installed and type conda install -c r r-PACKAGENAME. This approach to R package installs is life changing, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re all too familiar with non-zero exit status or random failures when attempting to install R packages.\nYou can also view your list of installed R packages in your environment, conda list r-.\nConda channels for R package installation Some package groups require installation through a different conda channel. Two of the main ones I use are bioconductor Bioconda and conda-forge.\nTo set this up, configure your R environment by executing these commands in this exact order:\n# Type these commands in this exact order: conda config --add channels defaults conda config --add channels bioconda conda config --add channels conda-forge  To install a package using one of these channels, use \u0026ldquo;-c\u0026rdquo; in the conda install command. For instance to install compositions and cowplot, you need to use the conda-forge channel. See install information here.\nconda install -c conda-forge r-compositions conda install -c conda-forge r-cowplot  Other examples which require Bioconda:\nconda install -c bioconda bioconductor-decontam conda install -c bioconda bioconductor-deseq conda install -c bioconda bioconductor-edger  Final thoughts Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of destruction. Behind the scenes of this post, I completely removed and re-installed Anaconda on my computer at least twice and created and then deleted numerous environments. Starting with a clean slate turned out to be necessary.\nAnother reason to not shy away from destruction is that it is a way towards a more reproducible work process. After deleting and reinstalling Anaconda (and every other conda environment to my name), I was able to easily reinstate the environment my collaborator and I share with no issues (you can rebuild!). And now, I can return to whichever R version I need for a given project by navigating between my R conda environments. How much fun is it to be organized?.\nAnaconda was built with Python in mind. My motivation for this post was that it was difficult to find a working solution to partition R versions using conda environments (especially in conjunction with IRKernel and RStudio). Anaconda seems to work more succintly with python; as an example, I found that some older versions of R were not as stable as others. But R support is constantly growing! Also, check out the newly released RStudio 1.2, which will support Python\nThere\u0026rsquo;s more than one way to do this. If you have another solution or addition - let me know!\n","date":1556568390,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556568390,"objectID":"abb9d758f1fb8f8420cdaa33d055c814","permalink":"https://alexanderlabwhoi.github.io/post/anaconda-r-sarah/","publishdate":"2019-04-29T16:06:30-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/anaconda-r-sarah/","section":"post","summary":"I recently found myself setting up a new computer, spinning up ~23864283.34 new projects in R, and wanting to stay somewhat organized in the process.

Rather than transfer the intermediate byproducts of these analyses (which may often be very large) to my local machine, I prefer to examine and analyze the data remotely using Jupyter. As jupyter notebook are browser-based, if you run the command jupyter notebook on a remote machine you will not be able to automatically interact with the jupyter dashboard as you do not have access to a browser on the remote machine. Rather, you need to create a connection between your local browser and the remote Jupyter session. Here I am showing a special case, where you might want to run jupyter notebooks on a larger compute node via an interactive session with slurm.\nStarting your interactive job with slurm First things first: start up a tmux session (or screen if you prefer). If I am looking to have some program running for longer than I am wanting to keep a terminal window open \u0026ndash; tmux or screen are great options as they keep your session from timing out on remote machines. I have a preference for tmux, but it is really up to you.\ntmux new -s jupyter  Now that we are in our new tmux session, it is time to request an real-time run on the remote HPC. Using the slurm command srun, I am asking for 2 hours to run on two CPUs on a queue called main. You can customize this to your needs and resources by requesting more nodes, memory, etc.:\nsrun -p main --time=02:00:00 --ntasks-per-node 2 --pty bash  This will log you onto some node which will be noted in your command prompt. For example, my command line prompt changed from halexander@hpc to halexander@node1.\nI have many commands that I like in my .bash_profile that are not otherwise carried over to this new machine that we just logged into, so go ahead and source my bash profile (source ~/.bash_profile).\nCreating a conda environment and starting a jupyter notebook I like to run each of my various projects in its own conda environment. There are many reasons for this: reproducibility, control over program versions, dealing with conflicting package requirements, and, especially for on a shared compute resource (like an HPC), bypassing having root permission for installing programs. Another nice bonus for this particular case is that conda environments will automatically have jupyter installed. So, create a conda environment (if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already):\nconda create conda-env  and activate it:\nsource activate conda-env  You should now see that your terminal prompt has changed to something like the following, indicating that you are logged onto the interactive node and working within the conda-env environment:\n(conda-env) halexander@node1  One issue I encountered (that may be specific to my local HPC) that I want to note. If I try to run the command jupyter notebook right away I get the following error:\nTraceback (most recent call last): File \u0026quot;/address/home/halexander/.conda/envs/conda-env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/traitlets/traitlets.py\u0026quot;, line 528, in get value = obj._trait_values[self.name] KeyError: 'runtime_dir' .... PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/run/user/12746'  To get around this issue I found some help on StackOverflow. (Google is your friend for pesky errors like this.) This simple export command fixed my problem:\nexport XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;  Now, it is time to start up a jupyter notebook! On the remote machine type:\njupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888  (Note, the default is for jupyter notebook to automatically open a browser \u0026ndash; but we can\u0026rsquo;t do that on a remote server, so we bypass that function with the --no-browser flag.)\nI regularly want to run this command and hate typing, so I went ahead and created a function to streamline this process:\nfunction jpt(){ jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=$1 }  This allows you to just type jpt and a port number and the command will be taken care of. If you want to use this function, simply copy the above and place it in your .bash_profile.\nNow, jpt 8888 will start a jupyter notebook on the port 8888.\nIf all is well, after running the above command, you should see something like the following:\n[I 14:22:55.931 NotebookApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /hpc/home/halexander/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/notebook_cookie_secret [I 14:23:01.371 NotebookApp] [jupyter_nbextensions_configurator] enabled 0.4.1 [I 14:23:01.371 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /vortexfs1/scratch/halexander/tara/sourmash-analysis [I 14:23:01.371 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: [I 14:23:01.371 NotebookApp] http://localhost:8888/ [I 14:23:01.371 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).  ##Creating an SSH tunnel\nYou are now ready to create a tunnel from your local computer to the jupyter notebook running on the HPC.\nOpen a new terminal on your local machine. In the above example, I started a notebook on node1 at port 8888 and my username is halexander and the address of my HPC is hpc.address.edu. So, to create the tunnel I would type the following:\nssh -t -t halexander@hpc.address.edu -L 8888:localhost:8888 ssh node1 -L 8888:localhost:8888  This is a lot of typing, so it is simpler to create another bash function that you can put in your local .bash_profile.\nfunction jptnode(){ # Forwards port $1 from node $2 into port $1 on the local machine and listens to it ssh -t -t halexander@hpc.address.edu -L $1:localhost:$1 ssh $2 -L $1:localhost:$1 }  You will of course want to customize the above function to contain your username in place of halexander and the address of your hpc in place of hpc.address.edu.\nThe $ indicates the input variables in this function, with $1 being the port you specified for the jupyter notebook and $2 being the name of the node you are running the notebook on. So, to use this function you would type:\njptnode 8888 node1  Once you run this, you should notice that your terminal window has been logged on to your remote HPC and then logged onto the requested node.\nYou can now open your browser of choice and go to localhost:8888 and you should see the jupyter dashboard.

Re-analysis of existing data provides an affordable means of generating new information and will likely become more routine within biology, yet necessitates a new set of considerations for best practices and resource development.

Despite the prevalence of transcriptomic studies, the effects of using different workflows, or “pipelines”, on the resulting assemblies are poorly understood. Here, a pipeline was programmatically automated and used to assemble and annotate raw transcriptomic short read data collected by the Marine Microbial Eukaryotic Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP). The resulting transcriptome assemblies were evaluated and compared against assemblies that were previously generated with a different pipeline developed by the National Center for Genome Research (NCGR). **Results** New transcriptome assemblies contained the majority of previous contigs as well as new content. On average, 7.8% of the annotated contigs in the new assemblies were novel gene names not found in the previous assemblies. Taxonomic trends were observed in the assembly metrics. Assemblies from the Dinoflagellata showed a higher number of contigs and unique k-mers than transcriptomes from other phyla while assemblies from Ciliophora had a lower percentage of open reading frames compared to other phyla. **Conclusions** Given current bioinformatics approaches, there is no single ‘best’ reference transcriptome for a particular set of raw data. As the optimum transcriptome is a moving target, improving (or not) with new tools and approaches, automated and programmable pipelines are invaluable for managing the computationally-intensive tasks required for re-processing large sets of samples with revised pipelines and ensuring a common evaluation workflow is applied to all samples.

Further, Fe and P geochemistries are linked through the activities of metalloenzymes, such as the alkaline phosphatases (APs) PhoX and PhoA, which are used by microbes to access dissolved organic P (DOP).

These systems often incur dramatic physicochemical changes, including macronutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) enrichment and depletion, on short timescales. Here, *H. akashiwo* cultures grown under nutrient replete, low N and low P growth conditions were examined for changes in biochemical and physiological characteristics in concert with transcriptome sequencing to provide a mechanistic perspective on the metabolic processes involved in responding to N and P stress. There was a marked difference in the overall transcriptional pattern between low N and low P transcriptomes. Both nutrient stresses led to significant changes in the abundance of thousands of contigs related to a wide diversity of metabolic pathways, with limited overlap between the transcriptomic responses to low N and low P. Enriched contigs under low N included many related to nitrogen metabolism, acquisition, and transport. In addition, metabolic modules like photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism changed significantly under low N, coincident with treatment-specific changes in photosynthetic efficiency and particulate carbohydrate content. P-specific contigs responsible for P transport and organic P use were more enriched in the low P treatment than in the replete control and low N treatment. These results provide new insight into the genetic mechanisms that distinguish how this HAB species responds to these two common nutrient stresses, and the results can inform future field studies, linking transcriptional patterns to the physiological ecology of *H. akashiwo* in situ.","tags":["de novo assembly","gene expression","harmful algal bloom","Heterosigma akashiwo","phytoplankton","transcriptomics","nutrient","phosphorus"],"title":"Transcriptional response of the harmful raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo to nitrate and phosphate stress","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew J.

Phytoplankton are known to exhibit similar physiological responses to limiting N and P conditions such as decreased growth rates, chlorosis, and increased assimilation of N and P. Are these responses similar at the molecular level across multiple species? To interrogate this question, five species from biogeochemically important, bloom-forming taxa (Bacillariophyta, Dinophyta, and Haptophyta) were grown under similar low N, low P, and replete nutrient conditions to identify transcriptional patterns and associated changes in biochemical pools related to N and P stress. Metabolic profiles, revealed through the transcriptomes of these taxa, clustered together based on species rather than nutrient stressor, suggesting that the global metabolic response to nutrient stresses was largely, but not exclusively, species-specific. Nutrient stress led to few transcriptional changes in the two dinoflagellates, consistent with other research. An orthologous group analysis examined functionally conserved (i.e., similarly changed) responses to nutrient stress and therefore focused on the diatom and haptophytes. Most conserved ortholog changes were specific to a single nutrient treatment, but a small number of orthologs were similarly changed under both N and P stress in 2 or more species. Many of these orthologs were related to photosynthesis and may represent generalized stress responses. A greater number of orthologs were conserved across more than one species under low P compared to low N. Screening the conserved orthologs for functions related to N and P metabolism revealed increased relative abundance of orthologs for nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and amino acid transporters under N stress, and increased relative abundance of orthologs related to acquisition of inorganic and organic P substrates under P stress. Although the global transcriptional responses were dominated by species-specific changes, the analysis of conserved responses revealed functional similarities in resource acquisition pathways among different phytoplankton taxa. This overlap in nutrient stress responses observed among species may be useful for tracking the physiological ecology of phytoplankton field populations.","tags":["conserved response","MMETSP","nitrogen","phosphorus","phytoplankton","transcriptomics","diatom","gene expression"],"title":"Conserved transcriptional responses to nutrient stress in bloom-forming algae","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Moniruzzaman","Louie L.

This may, in part, be due to differences in the physiological ecology of *Trichodesmium* species, which are not typically considered independently in field studies. In this study, the abundance of the two dominant *Trichodesmium* clades (Clade I and Clade III) was investigated during a survey at Station ALOHA in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) using a clade‐specific qPCR approach. While Clade I dominated the *Trichodesmium* community, Clade III abundance was 50% in some NPSG samples, in contrast to the western North Atlantic where Clade III abundance was always 80 m, while Clade III populations were only observed in the mixed layer and found to be significantly correlated with depth and temperature. These data suggest active niche partitioning of *Trichodesmium* species from different clades, as has been observed in other cyanobacteria. Tracking the distribution and physiology of *Trichodesmium* spp. would contribute to better predictions of the physiological ecology of this biogeochemically important genus in the present and future ocean.","tags":["Trichodesmium","biogeochemistry","Station ALOHA","diversity","qRT-PCR"],"title":"Variable depth distribution of Trichodesmium clades in the North Pacific Ocean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Harriet Alexander**","Mónica Rouco","Sheean T.

It has been hypothesized and experimentally demonstrated that nutrient loading can stimulate blooms of large eukaryotic phytoplankton in oligotrophic systems. Although central to balancing biogeochemical models, knowledge of the metabolic traits that govern the dynamics of these bloom-forming phytoplankton is limited. We used eukaryotic metatranscriptomic techniques to identify the metabolic basis of functional group-specific traits that may drive the shift between net heterotrophy and autotrophy in the oligotrophic ocean. Replicated blooms were simulated by deep seawater (DSW) addition to mimic nutrient loading in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, and the transcriptional responses of phytoplankton functional groups were assayed. Responses of the diatom, haptophyte, and dinoflagellate functional groups in simulated blooms were unique, with diatoms and haptophytes significantly (95% confidence) shifting their quantitative metabolic fingerprint from the in situ condition, whereas dinoflagellates showed little response. Significantly differentially abundant genes identified the importance of colimitation by nutrients, metals, and vitamins in eukaryotic phytoplankton metabolism and bloom formation in this system. The variable transcript allocation ratio, used to quantify transcript reallocation following DSW amendment, differed for diatoms and haptophytes, reflecting the long-standing paradigm of phytoplankton r- and K-type growth strategies. Although the underlying metabolic potential of the large eukaryotic phytoplankton was consistently present, the lack of a bloom during the study period suggests a crucial dependence on physical and biogeochemical forcing, which are susceptible to alteration with changing climate.","tags":["metatranscriptomics","phytoplankton","ecological traits","biogeochemistry","blooms","Station ALOHA","gene expression"],"title":"Functional group-specific traits drive phytoplankton dynamics in the oligotrophic ocean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Harriet Alexander**","Bethany D.

The vast diversity of the phytoplankton has long perplexed ecologists because these organisms coexist in an isotropic environment while competing for the same basic resources (e.g., inorganic nutrients). Differential niche partitioning of resources is one hypothesis to explain this “paradox of the plankton,” but it is difficult to quantify and track variation in phytoplankton metabolism in situ. Here, we use quantitative metatranscriptome analyses to examine pathways of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) metabolism in diatoms that cooccur regularly in an estuary on the east coast of the United States (Narragansett Bay). Expression of known N and P metabolic pathways varied between diatoms, indicating apparent differences in resource utilization capacity that may prevent direct competition. Nutrient amendment incubations skewed N/P ratios, elucidating nutrient-responsive patterns of expression and facilitating a quantitative comparison between diatoms. The resource-responsive (RR) gene sets deviated in composition from the metabolic profile of the organism, being enriched in genes associated with N and P metabolism. Expression of the RR gene set varied over time and differed significantly between diatoms, resulting in opposite transcriptional responses to the same environment. Apparent differences in metabolic capacity and the expression of that capacity in the environment suggest that diatom-specific resource partitioning was occurring in Narragansett Bay. This high-resolution approach highlights the molecular underpinnings of diatom resource utilization and how cooccurring diatoms adjust their cellular physiology to partition their niche space.","tags":["phytoplankton","diatom","nutrient physiology","niche partitioning","metatranscriptomics","gene expression"],"title":"Metatranscriptome analyses indicate resource partitioning between diatoms in the field","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexis Fischer","Emily Moberg","**Harriet Alexander**","Emily Brownlee","Kristen Hunter-Cevera","Kathleen Pitz","Sarah Rosengard","Heidi Sosik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1393650000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1393650000,"objectID":"a1212c663ffb68cf6401b27b06996320","permalink":"https://alexanderlabwhoi.github.io/publication/fischer2014/","publishdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fischer2014/","section":"publication","summary":"One of the most dramatic large-scale features in the ocean is the seasonal greening of the North Atlantic in spring and summer due to the accumulation of phytoplankton biomass in the surface layer. In 1953, Harald Ulrik Sverdrup hypothesized a now canonical mechanism for the development and timing of phytoplankton blooms in the North Atlantic. Over the next 60 years, Sverdrup’s Critical Depth Hypothesis spurred progress in understanding of bloom dynamics and offered a valuable theoretical framework on which to build. In reviewing 60 years of literature, the authors trace the development of modern bloom initiation hypotheses, highlighting three case studies that illuminate the complexity, including both catalysts and impediments, of scientific progress in the wake of Sverdrup’s hypothesis. Most notably, these cases demonstrate that the evolution of our understanding of phytoplankton blooms was paced by access not only to technology but also to concurrent insights from several disciplines. This exploration of the trajectories and successes in bloom studies highlights the need for expanding interdisciplinary collaborations to address the complexity of phytoplankton bloom dynamics.","tags":["critical depth hypothesis","Sverdrup","blooms","phytoplankton"],"title":"Sixty Years of Sverdrup: A Retrospective of Progress in the Study of Phytoplankton Blooms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Harriet Alexander**","Bethany D Jenkins","Tatiana A Rynearson","Mak A Saito","Melissa L Mercier","Sonya T Dyhrman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325394000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325394000,"objectID":"5ba5988ed4975123927df4c300915d1b","permalink":"https://alexanderlabwhoi.github.io/publication/alexander2012/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/alexander2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Genes that are constitutively expressed across multiple environmental stimuli are crucial to quantifying differentially expressed genes, particularly when employing quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays.
