In the past 50 years, *H. akashiwo* blooms have increased, occurring globally in highly eutrophic coastal and estuarine systems. These systems often incur dramatic physicochemical changes, including macronutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) enrichment and depletion, on short timescales. Here, *H. akashiwo* cultures grown under nutrient replete, low N and low P growth conditions were examined for changes in biochemical and physiological characteristics in concert with transcriptome sequencing to provide a mechanistic perspective on the metabolic processes involved in responding to N and P stress. There was a marked difference in the overall transcriptional pattern between low N and low P transcriptomes. Both nutrient stresses led to significant changes in the abundance of thousands of contigs related to a wide diversity of metabolic pathways, with limited overlap between the transcriptomic responses to low N and low P. Enriched contigs under low N included many related to nitrogen metabolism, acquisition, and transport. In addition, metabolic modules like photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism changed significantly under low N, coincident with treatment-specific changes in photosynthetic efficiency and particulate carbohydrate content. P-specific contigs responsible for P transport and organic P use were more enriched in the low P treatment than in the replete control and low N treatment. These results provide new insight into the genetic mechanisms that distinguish how this HAB species responds to these two common nutrient stresses, and the results can inform future field studies, linking transcriptional patterns to the physiological ecology of *H. akashiwo* in situ.","tags":["de novo assembly","gene expression","harmful algal bloom","Heterosigma akashiwo","phytoplankton","transcriptomics","nutrient","phosphorus"],"title":"Transcriptional response of the harmful raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo to nitrate and phosphate stress","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew J.

Phytoplankton are known to exhibit similar physiological responses to limiting N and P conditions such as decreased growth rates, chlorosis, and increased assimilation of N and P. Are these responses similar at the molecular level across multiple species? To interrogate this question, five species from biogeochemically important, bloom-forming taxa (Bacillariophyta, Dinophyta, and Haptophyta) were grown under similar low N, low P, and replete nutrient conditions to identify transcriptional patterns and associated changes in biochemical pools related to N and P stress. Metabolic profiles, revealed through the transcriptomes of these taxa, clustered together based on species rather than nutrient stressor, suggesting that the global metabolic response to nutrient stresses was largely, but not exclusively, species-specific. Nutrient stress led to few transcriptional changes in the two dinoflagellates, consistent with other research. An orthologous group analysis examined functionally conserved (i.e., similarly changed) responses to nutrient stress and therefore focused on the diatom and haptophytes. Most conserved ortholog changes were specific to a single nutrient treatment, but a small number of orthologs were similarly changed under both N and P stress in 2 or more species. Many of these orthologs were related to photosynthesis and may represent generalized stress responses. A greater number of orthologs were conserved across more than one species under low P compared to low N. Screening the conserved orthologs for functions related to N and P metabolism revealed increased relative abundance of orthologs for nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and amino acid transporters under N stress, and increased relative abundance of orthologs related to acquisition of inorganic and organic P substrates under P stress. Although the global transcriptional responses were dominated by species-specific changes, the analysis of conserved responses revealed functional similarities in resource acquisition pathways among different phytoplankton taxa. This overlap in nutrient stress responses observed among species may be useful for tracking the physiological ecology of phytoplankton field populations.","tags":["conserved response","MMETSP","nitrogen","phosphorus","phytoplankton","transcriptomics","diatom","gene expression"],"title":"Conserved transcriptional responses to nutrient stress in bloom-forming algae","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Moniruzzaman","Louie L.

In this study, the abundance of the two dominant *Trichodesmium* clades (Clade I and Clade III) was investigated during a survey at Station ALOHA in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) using a clade‐specific qPCR approach. While Clade I dominated the *Trichodesmium* community, Clade III abundance was 50% in some NPSG samples, in contrast to the western North Atlantic where Clade III abundance was always 80 m, while Clade III populations were only observed in the mixed layer and found to be significantly correlated with depth and temperature.

Responses of the diatom, haptophyte, and dinoflagellate functional groups in simulated blooms were unique, with diatoms and haptophytes significantly (95% confidence) shifting their quantitative metabolic fingerprint from the in situ condition, whereas dinoflagellates showed little response. Significantly differentially abundant genes identified the importance of colimitation by nutrients, metals, and vitamins in eukaryotic phytoplankton metabolism and bloom formation in this system. The variable transcript allocation ratio, used to quantify transcript reallocation following DSW amendment, differed for diatoms and haptophytes, reflecting the long-standing paradigm of phytoplankton r- and K-type growth strategies. Although the underlying metabolic potential of the large eukaryotic phytoplankton was consistently present, the lack of a bloom during the study period suggests a crucial dependence on physical and biogeochemical forcing, which are susceptible to alteration with changing climate.","tags":["metatranscriptomics","phytoplankton","ecological traits","biogeochemistry","blooms","Station ALOHA","gene expression"],"title":"Functional group-specific traits drive phytoplankton dynamics in the oligotrophic ocean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Harriet Alexander**","Bethany D.

The vast diversity of the phytoplankton has long perplexed ecologists because these organisms coexist in an isotropic environment while competing for the same basic resources (e.g., inorganic nutrients). Differential niche partitioning of resources is one hypothesis to explain this “paradox of the plankton,” but it is difficult to quantify and track variation in phytoplankton metabolism in situ. Here, we use quantitative metatranscriptome analyses to examine pathways of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) metabolism in diatoms that cooccur regularly in an estuary on the east coast of the United States (Narragansett Bay). Expression of known N and P metabolic pathways varied between diatoms, indicating apparent differences in resource utilization capacity that may prevent direct competition. Nutrient amendment incubations skewed N/P ratios, elucidating nutrient-responsive patterns of expression and facilitating a quantitative comparison between diatoms. The resource-responsive (RR) gene sets deviated in composition from the metabolic profile of the organism, being enriched in genes associated with N and P metabolism. Expression of the RR gene set varied over time and differed significantly between diatoms, resulting in opposite transcriptional responses to the same environment. Apparent differences in metabolic capacity and the expression of that capacity in the environment suggest that diatom-specific resource partitioning was occurring in Narragansett Bay. This high-resolution approach highlights the molecular underpinnings of diatom resource utilization and how cooccurring diatoms adjust their cellular physiology to partition their niche space.","tags":["phytoplankton","diatom","nutrient physiology","niche partitioning","metatranscriptomics","gene expression"],"title":"Metatranscriptome analyses indicate resource partitioning between diatoms in the field","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexis Fischer","Emily Moberg","**Harriet Alexander**","Emily Brownlee","Kristen Hunter-Cevera","Kathleen Pitz","Sarah Rosengard","Heidi Sosik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1393650000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1393650000,"objectID":"a1212c663ffb68cf6401b27b06996320","permalink":"https://alexanderlabwhoi.github.io/publication/fischer2014/","publishdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fischer2014/","section":"publication","summary":"One of the most dramatic large-scale features in the ocean is the seasonal greening of the North Atlantic in spring and summer due to the accumulation of phytoplankton biomass in the surface layer. In 1953, Harald Ulrik Sverdrup hypothesized a now canonical mechanism for the development and timing of phytoplankton blooms in the North Atlantic. Over the next 60 years, Sverdrup’s Critical Depth Hypothesis spurred progress in understanding of bloom dynamics and offered a valuable theoretical framework on which to build. In reviewing 60 years of literature, the authors trace the development of modern bloom initiation hypotheses, highlighting three case studies that illuminate the complexity, including both catalysts and impediments, of scientific progress in the wake of Sverdrup’s hypothesis. Most notably, these cases demonstrate that the evolution of our understanding of phytoplankton blooms was paced by access not only to technology but also to concurrent insights from several disciplines. This exploration of the trajectories and successes in bloom studies highlights the need for expanding interdisciplinary collaborations to address the complexity of phytoplankton bloom dynamics.","tags":["critical depth hypothesis","Sverdrup","blooms","phytoplankton"],"title":"Sixty Years of Sverdrup: A Retrospective of Progress in the Study of Phytoplankton Blooms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Harriet Alexander**","Bethany D Jenkins","Tatiana A Rynearson","Mak A Saito","Melissa L Mercier","Sonya T Dyhrman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325394000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325394000,"objectID":"5ba5988ed4975123927df4c300915d1b","permalink":"https://alexanderlabwhoi.github.io/publication/alexander2012/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/alexander2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Genes that are constitutively expressed across multiple environmental stimuli are crucial to quantifying differentially expressed genes, particularly when employing quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays.

Literature-based searches surveyed 18 generally accepted reference genes, revealing 101 homologs in *T. pseudonana* with variable expression and a wide range of mean tags per million. *k*-means analysis parsed the whole transcriptome into 15 clusters.
