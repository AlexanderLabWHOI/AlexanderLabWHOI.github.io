[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" I run the bulk of my bioinformatic analyses remotely on a server or HPC, as they require more computational power or space than I have on my local computer. Rather than transfer the intermediate byproducts of these analyses (which may often be very large) to my local machine, I prefer to examine and analyze the data remotely using Jupyter. As jupyter notebook are browser-based, if you run the command jupyter notebook on a remote machine you will not be able to automatically interact with the jupyter dashboard as you do not have access to a browser on the remote machine. Rather, you need to create a connection between your local browser and the remote Jupyter session. Here I am showing a special case, where you might want to run jupyter notebooks on a larger compute node via an interactive session with slurm.\nStarting your interactive job with slurm First things first: start up a tmux session (or screen if you prefer). If I am looking to have some program running for longer than I am wanting to keep a terminal window open \u0026ndash; tmux or screen are great options as they keep your session from timing out on remote machines. I have a preference for tmux, but it is really up to you.\ntmux new -s jupyter  Now that we are in our new tmux session, it is time to request an real-time run on the remote HPC. Using the slurm command srun, I am asking for 2 hours to run on two CPUs on a queue called main. You can customize this to your needs and resources by requesting more nodes, memory, etc.:\nsrun -p main --time=02:00:00 --ntasks-per-node 2 --pty bash  This will log you onto some node which will be noted in your command prompt. For example, my command line prompt changed from halexander@hpc to halexander@node1.\nI have many commands that I like in my .bash_profile that are not otherwise carried over to this new machine that we just logged into, so go ahead and source my bash profile (source ~/.bash_profile).\nCreating a conda environment and starting a jupyter notebook I like to run each of my various projects in its own conda environment. There are many reasons for this: reproducibility, control over program versions, dealing with conflicting package requirements, and, especially for on a shared compute resource (like an HPC), bypassing having root permission for installing programs. Another nice bonus for this particular case is that conda environments will automatically have jupyter installed. So, create a conda environment (if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already):\nconda create conda-env  and activate it:\nsource activate conda-env  You should now see that your terminal prompt has changed to something like the following, indicating that you are logged onto the interactive node and working within the conda-env environment:\n(conda-env) halexander@node1  One issue I encountered (that may be specific to my local HPC) that I want to note. If I try to run the command jupyter notebook right away I get the following error:\nTraceback (most recent call last): File \u0026quot;/address/home/halexander/.conda/envs/conda-env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/traitlets/traitlets.py\u0026quot;, line 528, in get value = obj._trait_values[self.name] KeyError: 'runtime_dir' .... PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/run/user/12746'  To get around this issue I found some help on StackOverflow. (Google is your friend for pesky errors like this.) This simple export command fixed my problem:\nexport XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;  Now, it is time to start up a jupyter notebook! On the remote machine type:\njupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888  (Note, the default is for jupyter notebook to automatically open a browser \u0026ndash; but we can\u0026rsquo;t do that on a remote server, so we bypass that function with the --no-browser flag.)\nI regularly want to run this command and hate typing, so I went ahead and created a function to streamline this process:\nfunction jpt(){ jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=$1 }  This allows you to just type jpt and a port number and the command will be taken care of. If you want to use this function, simply copy the above and place it in your .bash_profile.\nNow, jpt 8888 will start a jupyter notebook on the port 8888.\nIf all is well, after running the above command, you should see something like the following:\n[I 14:22:55.931 NotebookApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /hpc/home/halexander/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/notebook_cookie_secret [I 14:23:01.371 NotebookApp] [jupyter_nbextensions_configurator] enabled 0.4.1 [I 14:23:01.371 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /vortexfs1/scratch/halexander/tara/sourmash-analysis [I 14:23:01.371 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: [I 14:23:01.371 NotebookApp] http://localhost:8888/ [I 14:23:01.371 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).  ##Creating an SSH tunnel\nYou are now ready to create a tunnel from your local computer to the jupyter notebook running on the HPC.\nOpen a new terminal on your local machine. In the above example, I started a notebook on node1 at port 8888 and my username is halexander and the address of my HPC is hpc.address.edu. So, to create the tunnel I would type the following:\nssh -t -t halexander@hpc.address.edu -L 8888:localhost:8888 ssh node1 -L 8888:localhost:8888  This is a lot of typing, so it is simpler to create another bash function that you can put in your local .bash_profile.\nfunction jptnode(){ # Forwards port $1 into port $2 and listens to it ssh -t -t halexander@hpc.address.edu -L $1:localhost:$1 ssh $2 -L $1:localhost:$1 }  You will of course want to customize the above function to contain your username in place of halexander and the address of your hpc in place of hpc.address.edu.\nThe $ indicates the input variables in this function, with $1 being the port you specified for the jupyter notebook and $2 being the name of the node you are running the notebook on. So, to use this function you would type:\njptnode 8888 node1  Once you run this, you should notice that your terminal window has been logged on to your remote HPC and then logged onto the requested node.\nYou can now open your browser of choice and go to localhost:8888 and you should see the jupyter dashboard. You should be able to start working in jupyter notebooks, downloading data, or do any other things you want to do through the jupyter dashboard. Make sure to shutdown the jupyter notebook when you are done.\nA few important notes 1) Before you connect to a remote server with jupyter notebook make sure that you have configured jupyter with password information. You can do this by editing the jupyter-notebook_config.json which is usually located in ~/.jupyter or by typing:\njupyter notebook password  which will prompt you for a password that will be used for future notebooks.\n2) Make sure you shutdown your jupyter notebook when you are done. To do this, you can log back onto the tmux session you started earlier (tmux a -t jupyter) where the jupyter notebook is running and use ctrl-C should shutdown the jupyter notebook. If you run into issues with a port still being used, chances are that a notebook is still running somewhere.\n","date":1552262400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552262400,"objectID":"6f7254440188574e53ae385500896786","permalink":"https://alexanderlabwhoi.github.io/post/2019-03-08_jpn-slurm/","publishdate":"2019-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-03-08_jpn-slurm/","section":"post","summary":"Using SSH to tunnel into jupyter notebooks deployed remotely on slurm","tags":["conda","jupyter","HPC","computing","data analysis"],"title":"Running Jupyter Notebooks Remotely with Slurm","type":"post"},{"authors":["**Harriet Alexander**","Lisa K Johnson","C Titus Brown"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543640400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543640400,"objectID":"15d4d641a299e5dc325f409e0b286416","permalink":"https://alexanderlabwhoi.github.io/publication/alexander2018/","publishdate":"2018-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/alexander2018/","section":"publication","summary":"DNA sequencing technology has revolutionized the field of biology, shifting biology from a data-limited to data-rich state.

Despite the prevalence of transcriptomic studies, the effects of using different workflows, or “pipelines”, on the resulting assemblies are poorly understood. Here, a pipeline was programmatically automated and used to assemble and annotate raw transcriptomic short read data collected by the Marine Microbial Eukaryotic Transcriptome Sequencing Project (MMETSP). The resulting transcriptome assemblies were evaluated and compared against assemblies that were previously generated with a different pipeline developed by the National Center for Genome Research (NCGR). **Results** New transcriptome assemblies contained the majority of previous contigs as well as new content. On average, 7.8% of the annotated contigs in the new assemblies were novel gene names not found in the previous assemblies. Taxonomic trends were observed in the assembly metrics. Assemblies from the Dinoflagellata showed a higher number of contigs and unique k-mers than transcriptomes from other phyla while assemblies from Ciliophora had a lower percentage of open reading frames compared to other phyla. **Conclusions** Given current bioinformatics approaches, there is no single ‘best’ reference transcriptome for a particular set of raw data. As the optimum transcriptome is a moving target, improving (or not) with new tools and approaches, automated and programmable pipelines are invaluable for managing the computationally-intensive tasks required for re-processing large sets of samples with revised pipelines and ensuring a common evaluation workflow is applied to all samples. Thus, re-assembling existing data with new tools using automated and programmable pipelines may yield more accurate identification of taxon-specific trends across samples in addition to novel and useful products for the community.","tags":["de novo assembly","transcriptome","marine microbial eukaryote","protist","MMETSP","automated pipeline","re-analysis"],"title":"Re-assembly, quality evaluation, and annotation of 678 microbial eukaryotic reference transcriptomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Protists, or eukaryotic microbes, are key players in marine ecosystems, encompassing primary producers (phytoplankton), mixotrophs, and heterotrophs.

Further, Fe and P geochemistries are linked through the activities of metalloenzymes, such as the alkaline phosphatases (APs) PhoX and PhoA, which are used by microbes to access dissolved organic P (DOP).

In the past 50 years, *H. akashiwo* blooms have increased, occurring globally in highly eutrophic coastal and estuarine systems. These systems often incur dramatic physicochemical changes, including macronutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) enrichment and depletion, on short timescales. Here, *H. akashiwo* cultures grown under nutrient replete, low N and low P growth conditions were examined for changes in biochemical and physiological characteristics in concert with transcriptome sequencing to provide a mechanistic perspective on the metabolic processes involved in responding to N and P stress. There was a marked difference in the overall transcriptional pattern between low N and low P transcriptomes. Both nutrient stresses led to significant changes in the abundance of thousands of contigs related to a wide diversity of metabolic pathways, with limited overlap between the transcriptomic responses to low N and low P. Enriched contigs under low N included many related to nitrogen metabolism, acquisition, and transport. In addition, metabolic modules like photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism changed significantly under low N, coincident with treatment-specific changes in photosynthetic efficiency and particulate carbohydrate content. P-specific contigs responsible for P transport and organic P use were more enriched in the low P treatment than in the replete control and low N treatment.

Phytoplankton are known to exhibit similar physiological responses to limiting N and P conditions such as decreased growth rates, chlorosis, and increased assimilation of N and P. Are these responses similar at the molecular level across multiple species? To interrogate this question, five species from biogeochemically important, bloom-forming taxa (Bacillariophyta, Dinophyta, and Haptophyta) were grown under similar low N, low P, and replete nutrient conditions to identify transcriptional patterns and associated changes in biochemical pools related to N and P stress. Metabolic profiles, revealed through the transcriptomes of these taxa, clustered together based on species rather than nutrient stressor, suggesting that the global metabolic response to nutrient stresses was largely, but not exclusively, species-specific. Nutrient stress led to few transcriptional changes in the two dinoflagellates, consistent with other research. An orthologous group analysis examined functionally conserved (i.e., similarly changed) responses to nutrient stress and therefore focused on the diatom and haptophytes. Most conserved ortholog changes were specific to a single nutrient treatment, but a small number of orthologs were similarly changed under both N and P stress in 2 or more species. Many of these orthologs were related to photosynthesis and may represent generalized stress responses. A greater number of orthologs were conserved across more than one species under low P compared to low N. Screening the conserved orthologs for functions related to N and P metabolism revealed increased relative abundance of orthologs for nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and amino acid transporters under N stress, and increased relative abundance of orthologs related to acquisition of inorganic and organic P substrates under P stress. Although the global transcriptional responses were dominated by species-specific changes, the analysis of conserved responses revealed functional similarities in resource acquisition pathways among different phytoplankton taxa. This overlap in nutrient stress responses observed among species may be useful for tracking the physiological ecology of phytoplankton field populations.","tags":["conserved response","MMETSP","nitrogen","phosphorus","phytoplankton","transcriptomics","diatom","gene expression"],"title":"Conserved transcriptional responses to nutrient stress in bloom-forming algae","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Moniruzzaman","Louie L.

This may, in part, be due to differences in the physiological ecology of *Trichodesmium* species, which are not typically considered independently in field studies. In this study, the abundance of the two dominant *Trichodesmium* clades (Clade I and Clade III) was investigated during a survey at Station ALOHA in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) using a clade‐specific qPCR approach. While Clade I dominated the *Trichodesmium* community, Clade III abundance was 50% in some NPSG samples, in contrast to the western North Atlantic where Clade III abundance was always 80 m, while Clade III populations were only observed in the mixed layer and found to be significantly correlated with depth and temperature. These data suggest active niche partitioning of *Trichodesmium* species from different clades, as has been observed in other cyanobacteria.

It has been hypothesized and experimentally demonstrated that nutrient loading can stimulate blooms of large eukaryotic phytoplankton in oligotrophic systems. Although central to balancing biogeochemical models, knowledge of the metabolic traits that govern the dynamics of these bloom-forming phytoplankton is limited. We used eukaryotic metatranscriptomic techniques to identify the metabolic basis of functional group-specific traits that may drive the shift between net heterotrophy and autotrophy in the oligotrophic ocean. Replicated blooms were simulated by deep seawater (DSW) addition to mimic nutrient loading in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, and the transcriptional responses of phytoplankton functional groups were assayed. Responses of the diatom, haptophyte, and dinoflagellate functional groups in simulated blooms were unique, with diatoms and haptophytes significantly (95% confidence) shifting their quantitative metabolic fingerprint from the in situ condition, whereas dinoflagellates showed little response. Significantly differentially abundant genes identified the importance of colimitation by nutrients, metals, and vitamins in eukaryotic phytoplankton metabolism and bloom formation in this system. The variable transcript allocation ratio, used to quantify transcript reallocation following DSW amendment, differed for diatoms and haptophytes, reflecting the long-standing paradigm of phytoplankton r- and K-type growth strategies. Although the underlying metabolic potential of the large eukaryotic phytoplankton was consistently present, the lack of a bloom during the study period suggests a crucial dependence on physical and biogeochemical forcing, which are susceptible to alteration with changing climate.","tags":["metatranscriptomics","phytoplankton","ecological traits","biogeochemistry","blooms","Station ALOHA","gene expression"],"title":"Functional group-specific traits drive phytoplankton dynamics in the oligotrophic ocean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Harriet Alexander**","Bethany D.

The vast diversity of the phytoplankton has long perplexed ecologists because these organisms coexist in an isotropic environment while competing for the same basic resources (e.g., inorganic nutrients). Differential niche partitioning of resources is one hypothesis to explain this “paradox of the plankton,” but it is difficult to quantify and track variation in phytoplankton metabolism in situ. Here, we use quantitative metatranscriptome analyses to examine pathways of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) metabolism in diatoms that cooccur regularly in an estuary on the east coast of the United States (Narragansett Bay). Expression of known N and P metabolic pathways varied between diatoms, indicating apparent differences in resource utilization capacity that may prevent direct competition. Nutrient amendment incubations skewed N/P ratios, elucidating nutrient-responsive patterns of expression and facilitating a quantitative comparison between diatoms. The resource-responsive (RR) gene sets deviated in composition from the metabolic profile of the organism, being enriched in genes associated with N and P metabolism. Expression of the RR gene set varied over time and differed significantly between diatoms, resulting in opposite transcriptional responses to the same environment. Apparent differences in metabolic capacity and the expression of that capacity in the environment suggest that diatom-specific resource partitioning was occurring in Narragansett Bay. This high-resolution approach highlights the molecular underpinnings of diatom resource utilization and how cooccurring diatoms adjust their cellular physiology to partition their niche space.","tags":["phytoplankton","diatom","nutrient physiology","niche partitioning","metatranscriptomics","gene expression"],"title":"Metatranscriptome analyses indicate resource partitioning between diatoms in the field","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexis Fischer","Emily Moberg","**Harriet Alexander**","Emily Brownlee","Kristen Hunter-Cevera","Kathleen Pitz","Sarah Rosengard","Heidi Sosik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1393650000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1393650000,"objectID":"a1212c663ffb68cf6401b27b06996320","permalink":"https://alexanderlabwhoi.github.io/publication/fischer2014/","publishdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fischer2014/","section":"publication","summary":"One of the most dramatic large-scale features in the ocean is the seasonal greening of the North Atlantic in spring and summer due to the accumulation of phytoplankton biomass in the surface layer.

Over the next 60 years, Sverdrup’s Critical Depth Hypothesis spurred progress in understanding of bloom dynamics and offered a valuable theoretical framework on which to build. In reviewing 60 years of literature, the authors trace the development of modern bloom initiation hypotheses, highlighting three case studies that illuminate the complexity, including both catalysts and impediments, of scientific progress in the wake of Sverdrup’s hypothesis.
