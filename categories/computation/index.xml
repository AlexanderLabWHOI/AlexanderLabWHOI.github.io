      <description>RStudio was once my favorite and most often-used IDE. And there are still a lot of reasons to use it, even if you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to something like Spyder or Jupyter. RStudio is a clean IDE that allows you to simultaneously view your filesystem, environment variables, R scripts, and console, and is all very specifically tailored to R, which is important in many cases (R is an amazing but finicky language).</description>

      <description>Over the last few years I have made a transition in my workflow from doing most of my data exploration and plotting on my local machine (a 2016 MacBook laptop) to doing most of my plotting on a remote HPC (check out this other blog post for more on that). This workflow is very convenient for many reasons (keeping all files in one location, more extensibility and power for my notebooks that my personal laptop can&amp;rsquo;t handle, minimizing file storage on my local machine, etc.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of reasons to set up Google Drive integration on your remote HPC system. In particular if your institution has provided you access to G Suite, there is a lot of storage available on Google Drive. Sometimes you might want to access files from multiple HPC systems, or have them at your fingertips on your local machine in addition to a remote server. This blog post will go over how to set up and use rclone with Google Drive on your remote server.</description>

      <description>Harriet wrote an awesome blog post here about how to use a Jupyter notebook connected to a remote server via SSH tunneling. Unfortunately, depending on your existing setup on your computer, you may have a few extra steps to wrangle if you have a PC. In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll highlight what you should do after you get the Jupyter notebook running on the remote. In other words, you should have already gotten to the step where you spin up the Jupyter notebook, as in:</description>

      <title>Running Jupyter Notebooks Remotely with Slurm</title>

      <description>I run the bulk of my bioinformatic analyses remotely on a server or HPC, as they require more computational power or space than I have on my local computer. Rather than transfer the intermediate byproducts of these analyses (which may often be very large) to my local machine, I prefer to examine and analyze the data remotely using Jupyter. As jupyter notebook are browser-based, if you run the command jupyter notebook on a remote machine you will not be able to automatically interact with the jupyter dashboard as you do not have access to a browser on the remote machine.</description>
