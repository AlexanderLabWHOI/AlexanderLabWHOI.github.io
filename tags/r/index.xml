      <description>RStudio was once my favorite and most often-used IDE. And there are still a lot of reasons to use it, even if you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to something like Spyder or Jupyter.

      <description>I recently found myself setting up a new computer, spinning up ~23864283.34 new projects in R, and wanting to stay somewhat organized in the process. After doing some digging, I decided to give Anaconda environments a try to have the ability to run different versions of R and do this across R on the command line, RStudio, and jupyter notebooks (IRKernel). I have decided to share my process.
Installing Anaconda First, let&amp;rsquo;s make sure Anaconda is installed.</description>
